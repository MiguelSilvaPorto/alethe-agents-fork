/**
 * Decides what a wheel turn means.
 *
 * The `ignore` case is the one worth explaining, because it looks like doing nothing and is in fact
 * a fix. When a full-screen app is running and has NOT asked for mouse events, xterm's default is to
 * convert the wheel into cursor-key sequences and send them to the app — there is no scrollback in
 * the alternate buffer, so it offers the next best thing.
 *
 * For an app that reads arrows as "scroll", that is helpful. For one that reads them as input it is
 * silent typing: scrolling in Claude Code moved through its prompt history instead of the view.
 * Confirmed from the recorded PTY streams on this machine — Claude Code enters the alternate screen
 * seven times in one session and never once enables mouse tracking, while OpenCode enables it nine
 * times and therefore scrolls correctly on its own.
 *
 * So: forward to an app that asked for the mouse, and otherwise swallow the event rather than turn a
 * scroll gesture into keystrokes the user never typed. Shift always forces host scrollback, the
 * iTerm2 / Windows Terminal convention.
